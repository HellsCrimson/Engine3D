# 3D Engine
3D Engine made in C++.  
It is based of the video serie [Code-It-Yourself](https://youtu.be/ih20l3pJoeU) from One Lone Coder.

Currently, the movement are implemented with the ZQSD keys and AE for lateral movement.  
There is also W for activating the wireframe mode and C to show when clipping of triangles occur.  

The Engine currently looks like this:
